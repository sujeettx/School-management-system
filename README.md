School Management System
This is a backend application for managing a school system, including students, teachers, classes, and administrators. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The app provides APIs to handle CRUD operations for teachers, students, and classes while ensuring secure access with JWT-based authentication.

Features
User Roles: Admin and regular users (students/teachers).
JWT Authentication: Secured routes with role-based access.
CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for:
Teachers
Students
Classes
Database Relationships:
Classes are linked to Teachers.
Students are associated with Classes.
Validation: Ensures proper input through schema-defined fields.

Testing APIs with Postman
Register or Login

Use the /api/Admin/register endpoint to register a user.
Use the /api/Admin/login endpoint to log in and get a token.
Add Authorization Header

After login, copy the JWT token.
Add the token to the Authorization header of every subsequent request as Bearer <token>.
Access APIs

Test the APIs using the provided routes, passing the required payloads.
Additional Enhancements (Future Scope)
Upload Images: Integrate file/image uploads (e.g., with Cloudinary).
Frontend: Develop a React.js or Angular-based frontend to consume the backend APIs.
Pagination: Implement pagination for listing students, teachers, or classes.
Detailed Role Management: Add more granular role-based access controls.
Conclusion
This backend system is a robust, scalable solution for managing a school’s data. It provides secure authentication, CRUD functionality, and a clear structure for further extensions.
